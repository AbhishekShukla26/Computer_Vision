# PAN Card Tampering Detection




## Overview

The PAN Card Tampering Detection project focuses on detecting tampered PAN card images by leveraging image processing techniques. This project uses Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), thresholding, and contour detection to compare original and tampered images, providing a robust way to detect unauthorized alterations in the PAN card.


## Features

- Converts images to grayscale for simplified comparison
- Utilizes the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to detect changes between original and suspected tampered images
- Employs Otsu's thresholding for effective segmentation
- Detects contours for identifying altered regions
- Highlights and marks the tampered regions of the PAN card
